INSTRUCTIONS GUIDE

1. Upload "calendar.php" and "calendar" folder to your web.
2. You must upload the 2 files together, otherwise the script won't work correctly.
3. Don't change the name of any files because it will probably crash all the script.
4. When the 2 files have been uploaded to the web go to "calendar/install.php" and complete the form. ONCE YOU HAVE FINISHED THE INSTALLATION, continue to step 5.
5. Now delete the "install.php" file located in the calendar folder.
